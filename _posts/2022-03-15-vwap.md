Most people like myself who aren't familiar with finance can get lost with terminology. I've bought stocks using online brokers but working in the financial sector, you can to see a bigger picture that is often not known to the public. One of the metrics most brokerages use is the volume weighted average price, abbreviated as VWAP. Throughout the trading day, VWAP represents the average price the shares were traded. Each trade consists of the number of shares executed and price that they were executed. Suppose that there were $N$ many trades throughout the day (here we only deal with regular market from 9:30 to 16:00), then 

$$ \text{VWAP} = {\sum_n^N \text{price}_n \cdot \text{volume}_n \over \sum_n^N \text{volume}_n}.$$
